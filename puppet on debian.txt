#Try to ping with the domain name if they are ping successfully we can continue if they are not ping each other then check the file entry 


#Configure Puppet on Server Host (/etc/puppet/puppet.conf) and past the below contain

#For example, to allocate 1GB of memory, use JAVA_ARGS="-Xms1g -Xmx1g"; for 512MB, use JAVA_ARGS="-Xms512m -Xmx512m"

#Restart the puppetserver service
> sudo systemctl restart puppetserver

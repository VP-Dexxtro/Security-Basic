# TCP/IP

Developed by DOD (Deparment of defense)
	
	-1990
	
	- concise version of OSI Model
	- it contain four layer
			
			1. Application			  --> Http,ssh,NTP
			2. Transport			  --> TCP, UDP
			3. Network /Internet (IP) --> IP, ICMP, ARP
			4. Network Access layer	  --> PPP, Framing, IEEE 802.2 framing 
	
# OSI Model

Developed by ISO 
	- 1984
	
	Data flow :
			
			1. Application Layer: Applications create the data.
			2. Presentation Layer: Data is formatted and encrypted.
			3. Session Layer: Connections are established and managed.
			4. Transport Layer: Data is broken into segments for reliable delivery.
			5. Network Layer: Segments are packaged into packets and routed.
			6. Data Link Layer: Packets are framed and sent to the next device.
			7. Physical Layer: Frames are converted into bits and transmitted physically

	1. Application Layer	--> Network Virtual terminal,Mail Services, SMTP 
	2. Presentation Layer	--> Translation Layer, Encryption/ Decryption, Compression, JPEG, MPEG, GIF
	3. Session layer		--> Session, Mantainace, Termination, Synchronization, Dialog Controller, PPTP,NetBIOS
	4. Transport Layer		--> Segements, retransmit data if error found, ports, TCP, UDP, NetBIOS, PPTP
	5. Network Layer		--> Packets,Routing,Logical addressing, Device(Router & Switch)
	6. Data Link layer		--> Framing,error-Control,Flow Control, Access Control, Devices	(Switch,Bridge)
								DLL divided into 2 layer	
										1. Logical link Layer
										2. Media Access Control

# STP (Spanning tree Protocol) :
	
	1. Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) is used to make a loop free network by monitoring the network to 
	   track all the links and shut down the least redundant ones. 
	   
	- Types of Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)	:
		
			1. Common Spanning Tree (CST) --> 802.1D
			2. Per VLan Spanning Tree (PVST) 
			3. Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP+) --> 802.1w
			4. Multiple Spanning Tree	  --> 802.1s 
			
# Virtual LAN (VLAN)
	- IT is a concept in which we can divide the devices logically on layer 2 (data link layer). 
	  Generally, layer 3 devices divide the broadcast domain but the broadcast domain can be 
	  divided by switches using the concept of VLAN. 
	- VLAN encapsulation ISL (Inter Switch Link) and 802.1Q
	  
	- VLAN Taging --> is a way to identify and distinguish VLAN traffic from other network traffic
	- LAN membership --> determines which devices are assigned to which VLANs
	- VLAN trunking --> allows multiple VLANs to be carried over a single physical link and 
	                    done using a protocol such as IEEE 802.1Q.
	- Vlan Management --> involves configuring and managing VLANs, including assigning devices 
	                      to VLANs, configuring VLAN tags, and configuring VLAN trunking
						  
	- Type of VLAN connection
			
			1. Trunk Link --> All connected devices to a trunk link must be VLAN-aware
							  All frames on this should have a special header attached 
							  to it called tagged frames.
			2. Access Link --> It connects VLAN-unaware devices to a VLAN-aware bridge
								All frames on the access link must be untagged.
			3. Hybrid Link --> combination of the Trunk link and Access link

# VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP) :
	- VTP is CISCO proprietary protocol used to maintain consistency throughout the network or 
	  the user can say that synchronizing the VLAN information in the same VTP domain
	- VTP allows you to add, delete and rename VLANs which is then propagated to other switches
      in the VTP domain. VTP advertisements can be sent over 802.1Q, and ISL trunks. 
	
# Routing Protocol	

		1. static --> manual setting-up
		2. Dynamic
				1. Distance-Vector (RIP,IGRP,RIPv2)
				2. link-State (OSPF,IS-IS)
				3. Hybrid (EIGRP)
				
1. RIP (Routing Information Protocol) :
		- dynamic routing protocol
		- use hop count
		- find best path 
		- Protocol Number UDP - 520
		- Administrative distance 120
		- Hop Count : --> lowest hop count is consider as best path and placed in routing table
		- RIP prevent routing loops 
		- Max hop count allowed for RIP is 15 and a hop of 16 is consider as network unreable
		- routing information is always broadcast
		- Full routing table are send in updates
		- Router always trust routing information recived from neighbour 
	
	- RIP v1 --> is classfull Routing Protocol because it doesn't send  sunet mask in routing updates
	- RIP v2 --> is Classless Routing Protocol because it send information of subnet mask in it routing updates
	
	- RIP timers :
		
		- Update Timer : 30 Secs
		- Invalid TImer : 
		- Hold down Timer : 180 Secs
		- Flush Timer : 

2. OSPF (Open Short Path First) :
		
		- link-state routing protocol
		- Protocol number 89
		- Administrative Distance 110
		- multicast address 224.0.0.5
		- Load balancing with equal-cost routes for the same destination 
		- oop-free topology using SPF algorithm. 
	
	- OSPF messages – 
		OSPF uses certain messages for the communication between the routers operating OSPF. 

		1. Hello message – These are keep-alive messages used for neighbor discovery /recovery. 
		                   These are exchanged every 10 seconds. This includes the following 
						   information: Router I’d, Hello/dead interval, Area I’d, 
						   Router priority, DR and BDR IP address, authentication data. 
		
		2. Database Description (DBD) – It is the OSPF route of the router. This contains the
                                  		topology of an AS or an area (routing domain). 
		
		3. Link state request (LSR) – When a router receives DBD, it compares it with its own DBD. 
		                              If the DBD received has some more updates than its own DBD 
									  then LSR is being sent to its neighbor. 
		
		4. Link state update (LSU) –  When a router receives LSR, it responds with an LSU message 
		                              containing the details requested. 
		
		5. Link state acknowledgement – This provides reliability to the link-state exchange process. 
		                                It is sent as the acknowledgement of LSU. 
		
		6. Link state advertisement (LSA) – It is an OSPF data packet that contains link-state routing
                                      		information, shared only with the routers to which 
											adjacency has been formed. 
											
	- Note – Link State Advertisement and Link State Acknowledgement both are different messages. 

	- Timers  
		1. Hello timer – The interval in which the OSPF router sends a hello message on an interface. 
						 It is 10 seconds by default. 
		
		2. Dead timer – The interval in which the neighbor will be declared dead if it is not able to 
		                send the hello packet. It is 40 seconds by default. It is usually 4 times 
						the hello interval but can be configured manually according to need. 
	
3. Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (IGRP) :
		
		- distance vector routing protocol
		- Protocol Number is 9
		- Update table : 90 seconds
		- Hold down Time : 280 second
		- Max number of hop allowed 255. it has a default value  of 100 and it often change to 50
		- Administrative Distance is 100
	
4. Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) :
		
		- Hybrid protocol (distance and link state)
		- Protocol no is 88
		- Administrative Distance
				1. Internal route --> 90
				2. External route --> 170
	
	- Timer 
		1. hello timer : 5 Second by default
		2. Dead Timer : 15 Second By deafult
